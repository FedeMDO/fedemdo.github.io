                    I'm a dev. I like to analyze problems and design solutions
                    to solve them. If you ask me, I prefer the backend side,
                    although I can get some frontend stuff done. I try to have
                    my code clean, consistent and performant. Every time I learn
                    something that would improve my code, I usually do
                    refactoring. Context, "it depends" and pragmatism are my
                    favourite words.

                        I faced a tech career because when I was a child I was
                        afraid from computers. I literally used to cry when I
                        pushed the "minimize" button in Paint (on an old Windows
                        95 OS) because the window dissapeared.

                        I'm in my earlies 20s struggling to finally have my CS
                        degree. I come from an argentinian medium-low class
                        family. Claudio, my father, is a truck mechanic. His
                        hands turned dark because of the motor oil and his back
                        hurts. Cristina, my mother, takes care of the house but
                        she also works in a government office. I still remember
                        when she didn't eat on certain nights so that me and my
                        brothers can. I used to have a sister but meningitis
                        take her away from me on March 2003.

                    <p>
                        I played football for 12 years when I was a child.
                        Fortunately, before finishing high-school I realised I
                        wasn't good enough to reach professionality and make a
                        living from it. So i went to university.

                        I had my first girlfiend when I was 15 but it didn't
                        lasted too much. Then I met other girl. we're still
                        together after 6 years. I've tried to turn her into the
                        dev world but she prefers medicine.

                        Thanks to a student exchange program between my country
                        and France, and without knowing how it feels to be on a
                        plane, I went to Paris to study on
                        <a href="https://www.ensea.fr/fr"
                            >an engineering school</a
                        >
                        for 1 year. So I learned french! There, I only had
                        brazilians friends. So I learned (a bit of) portuguese!
                        And I can comunicate with some humble fluency in
                        english.

                <p>
                    I also do research and I have several papers published on
                    national journals. High Performance Computing and Simulation
                    stuff.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Having lived some years in this dev world, I love it because
                    it continues being a craft. And, as in all crafts, you can
                    leave your special touch. It's not far from art, isn't it?
