        <p>
          I'm a dev. I like to analyze problems and design solutions to solve them. If you ask me, I prefer the backend side, although I can get some frontend stuff done.
          I try to have my code clean, consistent, beautiful and performant. Every time I learn something that would improve my code, I usually do refactoring.
          Context, "it depends" and pragmatism are my favourite words.
        </p>

          <p>
            I faced a tech career because when I was a child I was afraid from computers. 
            I literally used to cry when I pushed the "minimize" button in Paint (on an old Windows 95 OS) because the window dissapeared.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            I'm in my earlies 20s struggling to finally have my CS degree. I come from an argentinian medium-low class family. 
            Claudio, my father, is a truck mechanic. His hands turned dark because of the motor oil and his back hurts. 
            Cristina, my mother, takes care of the house but she also works in a government office. 
            I still remember when she didn't eat on certain nights so that me and my brothers can. 
            I used to have a sister but meningitis take her away from me on March 2003.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            I played football for 12 years when I was a child. Fortunately, before finishing high-school I realised I wasn't good enough to reach professionality and make a living from it.
            So i went to university.
          </p>

          <p>
            I had my first girlfiend when I was 15 but it didn't lasted too much. Then I met other girl. we're still together after 6 years. 
            I've tried to turn her into the dev world but she prefers medicine.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Thanks to a student exchange program between my country and France, and without knowing how it feels to be on a plane, I went to Paris to study on <a href="https://www.ensea.fr/fr">an engineering school</a> for 1 year. 
            So I learned french! There, I only had brazilians friends. So I learned (a bit of) portuguese! And I can comunicate with some humble fluency in english.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          I also do research and I have several papers published on national journals. High Performance Computing and Simulation stuff.
        </p>

        <p>
          Having lived some years in this dev world, I love it because it continues being a craft. 
          And, as in all crafts, you can leave your special touch. It's not far from art, isn't it?
